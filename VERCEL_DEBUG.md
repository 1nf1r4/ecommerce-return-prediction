# Vercel Frontend 404 Debugging Guide

## Current Configuration ✅

### Root Package.json

- Created with proper build scripts
- `npm run build` runs `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`

### Vercel.json

- Simple configuration with:
  - `buildCommand`: "npm run build"
  - `outputDirectory`: "frontend/dist"
  - `installCommand`: "npm install"

### Build Output Verified ✅

- `frontend/dist/index.html` exists
- `frontend/dist/assets/` contains CSS and JS files
- Build completes successfully (866KB JS bundle)

## Potential Issues & Solutions 🔧

### 1. **URL Access**

**Problem**: You might be accessing the wrong URL
**Solution**: Make sure you're visiting the main Vercel app URL (not a subdirectory)

### 2. **Deployment Location**

**Problem**: Files might not be in the right location on Vercel
**Test**: Try accessing `/test.html` on your Vercel domain to see if static files work

### 3. **SPA Routing**

**Problem**: React Router needs proper fallback
**Solution**: Added `_redirects` file in `frontend/public/`

### 4. **Build Cache**

**Problem**: Vercel might be serving old cached version
**Solution**: Try a fresh deployment or clear cache

## Testing Steps 🧪

1. **Test Static File**: Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/test.html`

   - If this works: Issue is with React app
   - If this fails: Issue is with Vercel deployment

2. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools and check:

   - Network tab for failed requests
   - Console for JavaScript errors
   - Application tab for service workers

3. **Test Different Routes**:
   - `/` (should load React app)
   - `/signin` (should load React app)
   - `/assets/index-*.js` (should load JS file)

## Expected Behavior ✅

1. **Successful Build**: ✅ Confirmed working
2. **Static Files Served**: Should work with simple vercel.json
3. **SPA Routing**: `_redirects` file handles fallback to index.html
4. **React App Loads**: Should show your landing page

## Debugging Commands 🔍

```bash
# Test local build
cd frontend && npm run build && npx serve dist

# Check build output
ls -la frontend/dist/
cat frontend/dist/index.html
```

## Next Steps 🎯

1. **Access the Test Page**: Try `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/test.html`
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
3. **Try Fresh Deploy**: Sometimes Vercel cache needs clearing
4. **Verify Domain**: Make sure you're using the correct Vercel app URL

If test.html works but the main app doesn't, the issue is likely with React Router configuration.
If test.html doesn't work, there's a Vercel deployment/configuration issue.

## Current File Structure Expected by Vercel

```
/
├── package.json (root build commands)
├── vercel.json (deployment config)
└── frontend/
    ├── dist/ (build output)
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── assets/
    └── public/
        ├── _redirects (SPA routing)
        └── test.html (debug file)
```

The configuration should now work for a standard React SPA deployment! 🚀
