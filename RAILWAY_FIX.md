# Railway Deployment Health Check Fix

## Problem Identified üîç

The Railway deployment was failing health checks because:

1. **Heavy Model Loading**: The FastAPI app was trying to load ML models during startup via agent imports
2. **Synchronous Agent Initialization**: Agents were being imported at module level, causing blocking operations
3. **Missing Fallback**: No graceful degradation when models couldn't be loaded
4. **PORT Environment Variable Issue**: `$PORT` wasn't being properly expanded in uvicorn command

## Solutions Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Lightweight Health Check**

- Created a simple `/health` endpoint that doesn't require model loading
- Moved the heavy agent testing to `/health/detailed`
- Health check now returns immediately with basic status

### 2. **Lazy Router Loading**

- Modified `main.py` to use lazy loading of API routers
- Routers are loaded after app startup using lifespan events
- Prevents model loading during initial app creation

### 3. **Graceful Fallback System**

- Created `api/minimal.py` with heuristic-based predictions
- Falls back to minimal API if full routers fail to load
- Ensures the service is always available even without ML models

### 4. **Enhanced Startup Diagnostics**

- Added `start.sh` script with comprehensive startup checks
- Added `startup.py` Python-based startup script with better error handling
- Environment validation and port parsing
- Better error logging and diagnostics

### 5. **Fixed PORT Environment Variable**

- Python-based startup script properly handles PORT environment variable
- Validates port is a valid integer with fallback to 8000
- Multiple fallback mechanisms in Dockerfile
- Updated railway.toml with explicit startup command

### 6. **Improved Docker Configuration**

- Updated Dockerfile with better dependency management
- Added system dependencies for ML libraries
- Multiple startup fallback mechanisms
- Better logging and error handling

## Files Modified üìù

1. **`services/main.py`**

   - Lazy router loading with lifespan events
   - Lightweight health check
   - Fallback router system

2. **`services/api/minimal.py`** (NEW)

   - Heuristic-based prediction fallback
   - Works without ML models
   - Compatible API interface

3. **`services/start.sh`** (UPDATED)

   - Fixed PORT variable expansion
   - Better validation and error handling

4. **`services/startup.py`** (NEW)

   - Python-based startup script
   - Robust PORT environment variable handling
   - Comprehensive validation and logging

5. **`Dockerfile`** (UPDATED)

   - Multiple startup fallback mechanisms
   - Better dependency management
   - Fixed PORT handling

6. **`railway.toml`** (UPDATED)
   - Explicit startCommand using Python script
   - Better health check configuration
   - Restart policy settings

## Deployment Impact üöÄ

### **Health Check Success**

- `/health` endpoint now responds immediately
- No model loading required for health verification
- Railway health checks should pass within seconds

### **Service Availability**

- API starts quickly even if models aren't ready
- Graceful degradation to heuristic predictions
- Better user experience during startup

### **PORT Issue Resolution**

- Proper handling of Railway's PORT environment variable
- Validation and fallback for invalid port values
- Multiple startup mechanisms for reliability

### **Debugging Support**

- Detailed startup logging
- Environment validation
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Testing Results ‚úÖ

1. **Local Testing**: ‚úÖ Health endpoint works
2. **App Creation**: ‚úÖ FastAPI app creates without errors
3. **Import Testing**: ‚úÖ All critical imports successful
4. **PORT Handling**: ‚úÖ Python startup script validates PORT correctly
5. **Router Loading**: ‚úÖ All 3 routers load successfully in testing

## Next Steps for Railway üéØ

1. **Deploy Updated Code**: Push these changes to Railway
2. **Monitor Startup**: Check Railway logs for startup diagnostics
3. **Verify Health**: Health check should pass within 30 seconds
4. **Test Endpoints**: Verify `/health`, `/`, and prediction endpoints work

## Error Resolution Summary üí°

**Previous Error**: `Error: Invalid value for '--port': '$PORT' is not a valid integer`

**Root Cause**: Shell wasn't expanding the `$PORT` environment variable properly

**Solution**:

- Created Python-based startup script that properly handles environment variables
- Added validation and fallback mechanisms
- Updated Railway configuration for explicit startup command

The PORT and health check issues should now be fully resolved! üéâ
